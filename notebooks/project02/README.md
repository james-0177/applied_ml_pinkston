# Project 2:  Working with the Titantic Dataset

Project 2 uses the Titantic dataset to perform exploratory data analysis and machine learning preparation. I'll import, inspect, explore, and clean the data; and then I'll split the data for training and testing.

## Activate Project Virtual Environment

Since this project (and future projects for this course) all use the same repository, they will all use the same local virtual environment created for Project 1. All that needs to be done for each project is to activate.

```shell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Create new project directory and files with VS Code

Inside the notebooks directory, create a project02 subdirectory with the following files inside:
ml02_pinkston.ipynb
README.md

## Run initial Git Add / Commit / Push

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```
